# Medsky Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Medsky system is a comprehensive AI-powered student record analysis tool integrated into the Rootedu platform. It processes Korean student records (학생생활기록부) through a 4-stage pipeline to provide detailed feedback and analysis.

## System Architecture

### 4-Stage Processing Pipeline

1. **PDF Parsing** (`exp1_parsing.py` → TypeScript equivalent)
   - Uses LlamaCloud API for high-quality PDF text extraction
   - Handles Korean text with high-resolution OCR
   - Extracts tables in HTML format for better structure preservation

2. **Text Section Extraction** (`exp2_parsing_via_regex.py` → `textParser.ts`)
   - Regex-based parsing to separate document sections
   - Extracts: 창의적체험활동상황, 교과학습발달상황, 세부능력 및 특기사항
   - Validates completeness of extracted sections

3. **LLM Data Extraction** (`exp4_extraction.py` → `llmService.ts`)
   - OpenRouter API integration using DeepSeek Chat v3.1
   - Structured data extraction using 100% identical prompts from Python version
   - Parallel processing for optimal performance

4. **Validation Analysis** (`exp5_validation.py` → `llmService.ts`)
   - 5-category validation system with detailed feedback
   - Categories: blue_highlight, red_line, blue_line, black_line, red_check
   - Each represents different aspects of student record quality

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/medsky/process
Complete processing pipeline from PDF upload to final analysis.

**Request:**
```typescript
FormData: {
  file: File // PDF file
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  sessionId: string;
  result: ProcessingResult;
}
```

### GET /api/medsky/process?sessionId={id}
Retrieve processing results for a session.

### GET /api/medsky/status?sessionId={id}
Get current processing status.

### GET /api/medsky/health
System health check and configuration validation.

## Environment Variables

```env
# PDF Processing (Cost-Optimized - matches Python version exactly)
LLAMA_API_KEY="your-llama-cloud-api-key"
LLAMA_PARSE_MODE="parse_page_without_llm"
LLAMA_HIGH_RES_OCR="true"
LLAMA_TABLE_EXTRACTION="true"
LLAMA_OUTPUT_HTML="true"
# LLAMA_ADAPTIVE_LONG_TABLE="false"  # Disabled by default to save API costs

# LLM Processing
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
OPENROUTER_MODEL="deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Important Note**: The PDF processing configuration exactly matches the Python version (`exp1_parsing.py`) to ensure identical functionality and minimize LlamaCloud API costs. The `adaptive_long_table` feature is disabled by default since it wasn't used in the original Python implementation and would increase API usage costs.

## Validation Categories

### 1. Blue Highlight (파란색 하이라이트)
**Purpose:** 진로 역량 강조 - Career competency emphasis
- Direct connections between activities and career goals
- Evidence of career-related experiments, research, or projects
- Explicit career exploration depth and direction

### 2. Red Line (빨간색 밑줄)
**Purpose:** 구체적 노력·깊이 강조 - Concrete effort/depth emphasis
- Academic capabilities with self-directed, sustained effort
- Career capabilities with clear evidence of research methods
- Community capabilities showing motivation→action→change→learning flow

### 3. Blue Line (파란색 밑줄)
**Purpose:** 연계·후속 탐구 강조 - Connection/follow-up research emphasis
