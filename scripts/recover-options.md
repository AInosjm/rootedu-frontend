# Redis Data Recovery Options

## Option 1: Check if the decision engine service has cached data
The decision engine service at `/Users/gangjimin/Documents/main_dev/ainos/decision-engine/backend/` is still running. It may have cached data in memory.

## Option 2: Check application logs
Look for application logs that might contain the data that was stored:
- Check `/Users/gangjimin/Documents/main_dev/ainos/decision-engine/backend/logs/`
- Check system logs for Redis operations

## Option 3: File recovery tools
If the dump.rdb was recently overwritten, file recovery tools might be able to recover the previous version:
- TestDisk / PhotoRec
- Disk Drill (for macOS)
- Data recovery from the raw disk

## Option 4: Check if there are any database exports
Look for any JSON exports, SQL dumps, or backup files in the decision engine directory.

## Prevention for the future:
1. Enable Redis AOF: `redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly yes`
2. Set up regular backups: `redis-cli BGSAVE`
3. Use separate Redis databases or instances for different projects
4. Always use explicit connection strings, never fallback to localhost

## Immediate action to prevent further damage:
Stop Redis from auto-saving: `redis-cli CONFIG SET save ""`
